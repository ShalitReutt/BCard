### description

## The site is a project that was made by using React and the bcard Api(https://monkfish-app-z9uza.ondigitalocean.app/bcard2/cards). It contains a few pages: a main page where the user can find all the cards created by any users, about page where the user can read about the website, favorite-cards page where users that are loged-in can see all the cards liked by them, my-cards page where an business user can create a new card and see, edit or delete the cards he created previous. And the last important page is the sandbox page where admins can edit, delete or patch the business status of all the users(except other admin users, they cannot be deleted ).The project was made for practicing.

Last release 16/12/2023, reuploaded the repository and fixed gh-pages.

## There could be found an 404 error in the console that is a result of one of the users uploading a picture to which the link is not available anymore.
